          <p>
            It's essentially an infinite playlist generator! Given some starter tracks, this tool
            can be used to make countless new playlists for you to listen to.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">How do I use it?</h2>
          <p>
            First, make a Spotify playlist called play-whatever (must be that exact name). Next,
            fill it with some of your absolute favorite songs. That's it! You're ready to go.
          </p>
          <h2 class="subtitle">How does it work?</h2>
          <p>
            The songs you put in play-whatever are used to find other songs you might like, and
            they're put in a new playlist called whatever. After generating the whatever playlist,
            it'll take you right to it, so you can get to listening. If you get tired of whatever,
            you can come back here and generate a new playlist.

            <span class="u-bold">Diversity</span> is the number of tracks that will be used to seed
            the resulting playlist. For a more uniform playlist, choose a low diversity. For a
            highly varied playlist, choose a high diversity.
